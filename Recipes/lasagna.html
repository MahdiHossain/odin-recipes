    <h2>Recipe Description:</h2>
    <p>
        This recipe is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling.<br>
      A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.<br>
      I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
      <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Meaty Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>Deliciously Cheesy Filling (blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan)</li>
        <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>Leafy green salad</li>
        <li>Crusty garlic bread</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Prepare the meaty tomato sauce according to your preferred recipe.</li>
        <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a bowl, prepare the deliciously cheesy filling by blending small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan cheese together.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to the recommended temperature for baking the lasagna.</li>
        <li>Assemble the lasagna by layering the meaty tomato sauce, cooked lasagna noodles, and cheesy filling in a baking dish.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers until all the ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of meaty tomato sauce on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for the specified time.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and continue baking until the lasagna is bubbly and golden on top.</li>
        <li>Let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
      </ol>
